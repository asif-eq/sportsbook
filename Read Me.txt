This application imitates a sportsbook application.

There are 2 scripts.
1. Create Tables- 
2. Populate tables


There are 3 main modules in the  application. 

Sport module has 4 main functions

1. validate_sport()
1. create_sport() - an entry for a new sport can be created in the 'sport' table. This function performs some validations for input on sports. Such as the 'name' and 'slug' cannot be empty. And only allowed values for 'active' column are True/true/false/False

2. read_sport() - It will list all the sports currently in the database. 

3. update_sport_active_status() - this function can be used to update the active status for a sport. This function is also used to update the 'active' column to false once all the events of a particular sport are inactive.



When a selection is created its active status is true and outcome is unsettled.
Outcome of selection can be updated to void, lose or win.

The status of a selection can also be updated to false. Which means the selection is now inactive.

When a selection of an event becomes inactive the programme checks if all the selections of that event is inactive. If all selections are inactive the event becomes inactive too.
